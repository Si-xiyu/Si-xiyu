## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
HiðŸ˜Š! Iâ€™m Si-xiyu, a passionate and curious student at **SCUT** (South China University of Technology) based in vibrant Guangzhou, majoring in software engineering now. As an eager learner and problem solver, Iâ€™m fascinated by the endless possibilities in **Computer Science**, especially in cutting-edge fields like **Computer Vision**, **Machine Learning**, and **Robotics**, where technology meets creativity to solve real-world problems.  

Iâ€™m proficient in C++, Qt, and Python, and have a foundational understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MySQL. Iâ€™m currently expanding my skill set by learning Java and C#. To strengthen my theoretical and practical foundation, Iâ€™ve completed Harvardâ€™s CS50 and am now preparing to study CS61B (Data Structures), MIT 6.036 (Introduction to Machine Learning), and Discrete Mathematics (MATH1071).  
  
Beyond academic study, I actively take part in competitions to challenge myself and apply what Iâ€™ve learned. Iâ€™m also drawn to emerging technologies and enjoy working with like-minded peers on meaningful projects. When Iâ€™m not coding or studying, I love traveling â€” exploring new places and cultures not only helps me recharge, but also sparks creative ideas and fresh perspectives.  
  
If youâ€™re interested in discussing shared research interests, potential collaborations, or simply exchanging ideas, feel free to contact me at [junxiangluo0@outlook.com](mailto:junxiangluo0@outlook.com). Iâ€™m always open to meaningful conversations and new opportunities.

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
HiðŸ˜Š! Iâ€™m Si-xiyu, a passionate and curious student at **SCUT** (South China University of Technology) based in vibrant Guangzhou, majoring in software engineering now. As an eager learner and problem solver, Iâ€™m fascinated by the endless possibilities in **Computer Science**.  

Iâ€™m proficient in C++, Qt, and have a foundational understanding of Python. Iâ€™m currently expanding my skill set by learning Java and C#.   

If youâ€™re interested in discussing technical topics, open-source projects, or potential collaborations, feel free to reach out at junxiangluo0@gmail.com. Iâ€™m always open to meaningful conversations and innovative ideas.
